Microsoft Word includes a native feature called "Track Changes". When
combined with OneDrive, this allows for real-time collaboration and
version history. In contrast, plain text files are modified using
lightweight editors that lack inherent versioning tools. However,
version control systems can be used to track changes in plain
text files effectively.
