## Grading

Two written examinations are scheduled per semester. In addition, oral
participation is graded. Oral participation includes, in particular,
asking questions. 

The final grades are calculated as a weighted average of the two written
examinations and the oral participation grade. The average grade of the
two written examinations is weighted at 90%, while the grade for oral
participation is weighted at 10%. 

You have the opportunity to improve your mark in an upcoming exam. If
you report an issue through the link on the right-hand side before the
exam takes place, you may be awarded a maximum increase of one mark. To
report an issue, you must sign up with <a href="https://www.github.com"
