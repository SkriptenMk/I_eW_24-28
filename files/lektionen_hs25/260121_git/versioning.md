Microsoft Word includes a native feature called "Track Changes". When
combined with OneDrive, this allows for real-time collaboration and
version history. In contrast, plain text files are modified using
lightweight editors that lack inherent versioning tools. However,
version control systems can be used to track changes in plain
text files effectively. 

## How to track changes in plain text files

The de facto standard for versioning plain text files is Git.
Git is a versioning tool developed by Linus Torvalds, the father of the
Linux OS.
