### Introduction: What Is the Environmental Footprint of IT?

The environmental footprint of IT encompasses the entire lifecycle
of devices and services—from raw material extraction and
manufacturing to usage and disposal. This footprint is typically
divided into three main areas: the environmental costs of hardware,
the costs of computing, and the indirect costs, which include the
often-overlooked consequences of resource conflicts such as those
surrounding coltan.



## Environmental Costs of Hardware

IT hardware—computers, smartphones, servers—has a substantial
environmental impact, primarily through three channels:
**transport**, **mining**, and **construction**.

### Transport

The globalized nature of IT manufacturing means that raw materials
are sourced from around the world, assembled in countries like
China, and shipped to consumers everywhere. This complex supply
chain results in significant greenhouse gas emissions from
international shipping and logistics.

### Mining

Mining for essential minerals, such as copper, lithium, and
especially coltan (columbite-tantalite), is one of the most
environmentally damaging aspects of IT hardware production. Coltan
is crucial for producing tantalum capacitors, which are found in
nearly all smartphones and laptops. Mining operations often lead to
deforestation, water pollution, and the destruction of habitats for
endangered species. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
for example, coltan mining has contributed to the loss of 8.6% of
the country's tree cover since 2000 and has devastated populations
of gorillas and other wildlife.

### Construction

The manufacturing process for IT devices is energy-intensive and
relies on hazardous chemicals. Factories often use fossil fuels,
contributing to global warming. The short lifespan of many devices
leads to frequent replacement, increasing demand for new resources
and generating vast amounts of electronic waste (e-waste).
Globally, only about 22% of e-waste is properly recycled, with the
rest ending up in landfills or being processed under unsafe
conditions.


## Environmental Costs of Computing

Beyond hardware, the operation of IT systems—especially data
centers and networks—has a major environmental impact.

### Energy Consumption

Data centers, which store and process digital information, are
among the largest consumers of electricity worldwide. In 2024, data
centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity use, a
figure expected to rise with the growth of artificial intelligence
and cloud computing (such as running Jupyter notebooks online). The
IT sector as a whole is responsible for 3–4% of global greenhouse
gas emissions.

## Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)

This metric measures how efficiently a data center uses energy.
Lower PUE values indicate more efficient operations.

### Green Data Centers

To reduce their environmental impact, many organizations are
investing in green data centers. These facilities use renewable
energy sources, advanced cooling systems, and waste heat recovery
to minimize energy use and emissions.

## Swiss Example

The [Green Data Center
Zurich](https://www.green.ch/de/ueber-green/so-handeln-wir/energieeffizenz)
supplies waste heat to over 1,000 households, demonstrating how
digital infrastructure can support local energy needs while
reducing waste.

### Sustainable Software

Software also plays a role in energy consumption. Efficient code
and algorithms can reduce the amount of computing power required,
lowering both energy use and emissions. Sustainable software
development focuses on optimizing applications to use fewer
resources and extend the lifespan of hardware.

## Indirect Environmental Costs: The Case of Coltan Conflicts

The indirect costs of IT are often less visible but can be even
more severe than direct environmental impacts. One of the most
significant examples is the conflict over coltan in the DRC.

### Coltan: A Critical Mineral with a Heavy Toll

Coltan is essential for the production of tantalum capacitors,
which are used in almost every modern electronic device. The DRC
holds up to 70% of the world's coltan reserves, making it a key
player in the global supply chain. However, the extraction and
trade of coltan have fueled violent conflicts, human rights abuses,
and environmental destruction.


#### Conflict and Human Rights in the DRC Mining Sector

**Violence and Displacement** The security situation in eastern DRC
remains critical as armed groups, most notably the M23 rebels, have
consolidated control over strategic coltan mining hubs like Rubaya
to [finance their military
operations](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/dr-congo-militia-seizes-key-mining-town-rubaya-2024-05-01/).
This conflict has fueled a humanitarian catastrophe; as of early
2026, the number of internally displaced persons has reached a
staggering [7.3 million
people](https://dtm.iom.int/democratic-republic-congo), while
estimates from human rights monitors suggest that [thousands of
civilians](https://www.nrc.no/countries/africa/dr-congo/) continue
to be killed annually in related violence and territorial disputes.

**Child Labor and Exploitation** The artisanal mining sector
continues to rely heavily on exploitation, with an estimated
[40,000 children](https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour)
working in hazardous conditions in the DRC's mines for poverty
wages. Beyond child labor, international observers like [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr62/7009/2023/en/)
have documented systemic human rights violations, including forced
evictions of local communities and widespread sexual violence
against women and children, highlighting the devastating human cost
of the global demand for cobalt and coltan.


#### Economic and Environmental Impacts

**Resource Curse** Despite the DRC possessing vast mineral wealth,
the "resource curse" remains a stark reality: over [70% of the
population](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/drc/overview)
continues to live on less than $2.15 a day. While the global demand
for electronics drives high prices for coltan, most artisanal
miners earn only a few dollars per day, with the vast majority of
profits being siphoned off by [armed groups and corrupt
officials](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violence-democratic-republic-congo)
to sustain ongoing conflicts.

**Environmental Destruction** The expansion of unregulated mining
has led to catastrophic environmental consequences. According to
[UNEP reports](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/disaster-conflict),
mining operations have driven large-scale deforestation in the
Congo Basin, contaminated local water sources with heavy metals,
and destroyed critical wildlife habitats. These ecological damages
create long-term indirect costs that far outweigh the immediate
economic gains from mineral extraction.

#### Global Supply Chain Challenges

- **Smuggling and Fraud:**  
  Coltan from conflict zones is often smuggled into neighboring
  countries and mixed with legally sourced minerals, making it
  difficult for manufacturers to trace origins and avoid complicity
  in human rights abuses.
- **Certification and Regulation:**  
  International efforts, such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance,
  the Dodd-Frank Act in the US, and the EU Conflict Minerals
  Regulation, aim to improve supply chain transparency. However,
  enforcement is weak, and certification schemes have been
  undermined by fraud and lack of oversight.
