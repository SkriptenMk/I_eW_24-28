This requires the installation of\nWireshark. The \n<a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/#download\" target=\"_blank\">\nWireshark website</a>  provides the\ncorresponding download.\n\n\nTo record network packets, start Wireshark. The\nWireshark start window looks like this:\n\n![Wireshark start window](ws_start_window.png)\n\nUnder the heading ‘Capture’, you can select the desired network adapter\nand start recording. The captured packets\nare displayed in real time and can be analysed later. At\nschool, the connection to the Internet is established via WLAN.\nThe WLAN adapter must be selected accordingly. Once the appropriate\nadapter has been selected, recording can be started.\nRecording is started by clicking on the blue\nshark fin icon in the toolbar. Recording starts\nimmediately. Recording is paused by clicking on the\nred square icon in the toolbar. The recording can be saved either\nvia the File > Save menu, by clicking on the file icon\nor by using the key combination `Ctrl + S`.\n\n## Monitoring DNS requests\n\n### Filtering the recording\n\nTo monitor DNS requests, any website is called up while Wireshark\nrecording is running. This captures the\ncorresponding DNS requests, which can then be analysed in Wireshark.\nAfter calling up the website, the recording can be \npaused and the captured packets analysed (if the\nrecording continues, the packets in the display window\ncontinue to move).\n\nTo display the relevant data packets, the\nrecorded data traffic can be filtered. The filter is entered in the\ninput field for ‘Display filter’.\n\n\n![Wireshark display filter](ws_anzeigefilter.png)\n\nThe corresponding filter for DNS queries to a given website\nis\n\n```txt\ndns.qry.name == \"www.example.com\"\n```\n\nThe filter command used is relatively easy to understand.\nThe first thing to note here is the protocol being filtered. Because\nthe filtering is based on DNS queries, this is `dns`. `dns` alone\nwould already be a valid filter. However, this would then display all DNS packets\n. The filter is therefore supplemented to `dns.qry.name`, where\n`qry` is short for query. The addition `name` stands for the domain name\nthat is being queried. `==` is the logical operator used for filtering\nand means ‘is equal to’ in this case. The string being searched for is between the quotation marks.\nIf the page was accessed exactly once during recording, the filter will display two packets: one\nDNS query and one DNS response.\nIf the page was accessed multiple times during recording, the filter\nwill display multiple packets. \n\n\n![Filtered Wireshark packets](ws_dns_query.png)\n\nThe image shows the DNS query for\nwww.deutschegrammaphon.com as the first packet and the corresponding\nresponse as the second packet.\n\n### Analysis of the filtered packets\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the communication, a single packet can be\nselected by clicking on it. This will display the packet in the lower\narea of Wireshark in detail and it can be examined more closely.\n\n![Content of the selected packet](ws_selected_package.png)\n\nThat it is the details of the selected packet that are shown in the\nimage is evident from the matching packet number. The lines in the \ndetail view correspond to the individual protocol header fields of the\nselected packet. This also reflects the TCP/IP layering model.\n\nThe detail view can be expanded by clicking on the triangles at the beginning of the\nindividual protocol header fields. This will display\nfurther information about the respective fields. However, only the\nsummaries of the header fields are explained here. \n\nIn this example, the content of the Internet layer header is explained first.\n\n```text\n\nInternet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.1.108, Dst: 192.168.1.1\n\n```\n\nIn the summary, the source and destination addresses of the IP packet\nare displayed. In this case, these are the private IP addresses\n192.168.1.108 and 192.168.1.1. 192.168.1.108 is the source address,\nidentifiable by the abbreviation \"Src\", and 192.168.1.1 is the\ndestination address, identifiable by the abbreviation \"Dst\". Both\ndevices are thus located in the same LAN. The computer with the IP\naddress 192.168.1.1 is the router. This device establishes the Internet\nconnection and can answer DNS queries from its cache.\n\nIn the header for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the source and\ndestination ports are displayed.\n\n```text\nUser Datagram Protocol, Src Port: 53586, Dst Port: 53\n```\nThe source port was automatically chosen as 53586, well above the\nso-called \"Well-Known Ports\" (0-1023). The \"Well-Known Ports\" are ports\nthat are used by certain applications or services by default. Accordingly,\nthe destination port was set to 53, as this is the default port for\nDNS queries. A list of \"Well-Known Ports\" can be found in the\n<a\nhref=\"https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">\nofficial IANA port database</a>. The source port allows the\ndestination system to send the response back to the correct sender.\n\nNAT devices (see [Section Network Address Translation (NAT)](../250820/nat.qmd))\nuse this port information for the mapping between private and public addresses.\n\nThe layer displayed at the bottom of the detail view contains the actual\nrequest for the translation of the domain name into an IP address. \n\n```text\nDomain Name System (query)\n    Transaction ID: 0x1f7a\n    Flags: 0x0100 Standard query\n    Questions: 1\n    Answer RRs: 0\n    Authority RRs: 0\n    Additional RRs: 0\n    Queries\n        www.deutschegrammophon.com: type A, class IN\n    [Response In: 723]\n```\n\nFor this reason, this part of the analysis is also unfolded here.\nUnder the keyword `Queries`, the requested address\n`www.deutschegrammophon.com` is displayed. The keyword `type A` indicates\nthat this is a request for an IPv4 address.\nIPv4 addresses are designated with `A`, while IPv6 addresses are\ndesignated with `AAAA`. The last element in this line is the class of\nthe request, in this case `IN` for the Internet. Although today almost\nexclusively the Internet is used as a network type, the field for the\nclass (IN) is still part of every DNS request for historical reasons. \n\nThe corresponding content of the response looks as follows:\n\n```text\nDomain Name System (response)\n    Transaction ID: 0x1f7a\n    Flags: 0x8180 Standard query response, No error\n    Questions: 1\n    Answer RRs: 1\n    Authority RRs: 0\n    Additional RRs: 0\n    Queries\n        www.deutschegrammophon.com: type A, class IN\n    Answers\n        www.deutschegrammophon.com: type A, class IN, addr 85.236.46.65\n\n```\n\nThe packet repeats the question and provides the answer from the DNS server.\nThe domain name `www.deutschegrammophon.com` is associated with the IPv4 address\n`85.236.46.65`.\n\nThis allows the connection to the website `www.deutschegrammophon.com`\nto be established.\n\n## Monitoring of the Connection Establishment\n\nThe connection establishment between the client (local computer) and the server\n(computer on the Internet) takes place in several steps, which are summarized in\nthe so-called \"Three-Way Handshake\". This process ensures that both sides are ready\nto send and receive data.  \nThe following illustration shows a schematic representation of the \"Three-Way Handshake\".\n\n![Scheme Three-Way Handshake](schema_three-way-handshake.png)\n\nThe client sends a SYN packet to the server to request a connection.\nThe server responds with a SYN-ACK packet. This means it acknowledges the request with an ACK and inquires with a SYN whether the client is (still) ready to establish the connection. To make it clear that the ACK in the SYN-ACK packet refers to the original SYN packet, the individual packets are assigned a sequence number. The ACK returns the sequence number of the SYN packet plus one.\n\nThis process can be observed with Wireshark. For this, a combined Wireshark display filter is needed. As an example, the connection establishment between the local computer and the website of www.deutschegrammophon.com is considered. The first part of the filter should only display those packets that communicate with the IP address of the server of www.deutschegrammophon.com (85.236.46.65). This filter is\n\n```wireshark\nip.addr == 85.236.46.65\n```\n\nThis sole filter, however, still shows too many packets.\n\n![ip.addr filter](ws_ip-addr-Filter.png)\n\nTo further narrow down the results, only those packets should be displayed that have either the SYN flag or the ACK flag (or both) set. This can be achieved with the following filter:\n\n```wireshark\nip.addr == 85.236.46.65 and \n  (tcp.flags.syn == 1 or tcp.flags.ack == 1 )\n```\n\nStill, this shows way too many packets. Therefore, only those packets\nshould be displayed that are the responses to a SYN request. This can be\nachieved by right-clicking on a packet with the SYN flag and selecting\nthe \"Follow\" > \"TCP Stream\" option. This will display the entire TCP\nstream in which this packet is located (the consecutive packets). The\nfilter will be automatically adjusted. \n\nThe following listing shows the entire filter command for displaying the\npackets belonging to this TCP stream:\n\n```wireshark\nip.addr == 85.236.46.65 and \n  (tcp.flags.syn == 1 or tcp.flags.ack == 1) and\n  !(tcp.stream eq 8)\n```\n\n![Three-way handshake packets](ws_three-way-handshake.png)\n\nThat the packets show the communication sequence of the Three-Way\nHandshake can be seen from the set flags. In the first step, the client\nsends a SYN packet, to which the server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.\nThe client confirms this with an ACK packet. These three steps are\nvisible in the Wireshark filter. The respective port numbers used in the\nTCP packets are clearly recognizable. \n\nFollowing this \"Three-Way Handshake\", the client can communicate with the\nserver.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nThe following explanations are based on the analysis of network packets\nrecorded with Wireshark.
