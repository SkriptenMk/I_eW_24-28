{"title":"21 Plain Text Writing","markdown":{"headingText":"Plain Text Writing","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis section deals with an aspect of digital sustainability. In this\ncontext, digital sustainability is understood to mean that digital\nproducts can be represented independently of specific manufacturers. \n\nTo explain where the problem lies, we must first distinguish between two\nfile types: text files and binary files. \n\n## Text and Binary Files\n\nText files store their content as plain text. Formatting in such files\noccurs through control characters (see the ASCII table, specifically the\nexamples of character 9 for a horizontal tab or character 10 for a line\nbreak) and through conventions (see the formatting in Markdown or\nLaTeX).  \nAccordingly, they can be read in any text editor.  \nIn contrast, binary files are fundamentally bound to programs that can\nread their standard for creation, editing, and display. Their contents\nare stored as a sequence of bytes. An example of a binary file is a\ndocument created in MS Word. \n\nThis distinction shows that text files can fundamentally be displayed on\nany functioning computer with a text editor. By contrast, binary files\nusually require special programs that can interpret the respective file\nformat, which can lead to a certain dependency on corresponding\nsoftware. \n\nFurther information on the advantages of plain text writing can be found\nin the reference[@healy2020; @fix2020].\n\n## Plain Text Formats for Text Editing\n\nThe simplest form of a text file is a `.txt` file. This usually involves\njust text without formatting.  \nThe need for formatted text\nrepresentations has led to various file formats. These include, for\nexample, HTML files (`.html` or `.htm`: **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup\n**L**anguage). This format was originally created, among other things,\nto display formatted text on a screen.\n\nAnother example is LaTeX. LaTeX is also a so-called markup language.\nHowever, the target medium of LaTeX is less the screen and more print.\nToday primarily the Portable Document Format (PDF), which has developed\ninto a quasi-standard.\n\nHowever, the scope of formatting possibilities in both HTML and LaTeX is\nso extensive that the barrier to using them is relatively high. \n\nAgainst this background, a rather minimalistic markup language, Markdown\n(`.md`), was created. The Markdown language makes all essential\nformatting options, such as hierarchical headings or setting italicized\ntext, directly available. Where formatting provided by Markdown options\nare insufficient for one's needs, HTML or LaTeX tags can be used as a\nfallback in many cases.\n\nAn overview of formatting commands in Markdown can be found on the\n[Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\nwebsite. Important formatting in LaTeX (mathematical formulas) is\nexplained on the [Wikibooks\nLaTeX/Mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics)\nwebsite. \n\n# Converting Markdown to PDF\n\nMarkdown has the clear advantage of being readable in any text editor.\nUnfortunately, raw Markdown is not very aesthetic. Furthermore, most\ntexts must be converted into a PDF for the recipient.\n\nThe following text provides a step-by-step guide for the conversion of a\nMarkdown file to PDF.\n\n## Preparing for Conversion\n\nThe program [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) can be used for this\nconversion. Pandoc can convert Markdown into countless formats. The\nexact procedure is explained step-by-step below. \n\n1. **Install Pandoc**  \n   The installer for Pandoc can be downloaded from the\n   [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) website. \n   Follow the link \"Download the latest Installer\". For Windows,\n   download the file with the extension `.msi`.   \n   The downloaded installer can then be executed for installation with a\n   double-click. \n2. **Install LaTeX**  \n   For Pandoc to convert a Markdown document into a PDF, a LaTeX\n   installation is required on the computer. LaTeX is available for\n   Windows in various versions. The MiKTeX variant is the simplest to\n   install. The corresponding installation package can be downloaded\n   from the [MiKTeX website](https://miktex.org/download).   \n   The downloaded installer can then be executed for installation with a\n   double-click.   \n3. **Use Pandoc**  \n   Pandoc is a command-line program. This means there is no graphical\n   user interface for using Pandoc. Pandoc is easiest to use if a\n   terminal is opened in the folder containing the file to be converted.   \n   The conversion is performed with the following command:\n\n   ```bash  \n   pandoc -o output.pdf input.md\n   ```\n\n   `output.pdf` and `input.md` must be adapted to your own filenames.\n   Alternatively, other file formats, such as `.docx` or \n   `.html`, can be chosen as target formats. For a conclusive list of\n   all possible target formats, please refer to the Pandoc website. \n\n## Specific Formatting of the Output\n\nThe version shown above leads to a cleanly structured PDF. However,\nessential document parts such as a title page or table of contents are\nmissing. \n\nFor these advanced formattings, the necessary information is either\nprefixed to the document in a special header or passed to the conversion\ncommand in a separate document. The second variant will be presented\nhere. \n\nThe document with the formatting information is a so-called YAML\ndocument (`.yaml`). YAML stands for **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup\n**L**anguage. The document can have any name. Here in the example, it is\ncalled `format.yaml`. The following listing shows a formatting\nconfiguration with the author's name, the title, and other details. The\nmeaning of the individual entries is largely self-explanatory. \n\n```yaml\nfrom: markdown                      # Source format   \nto: pdf                             # Target format  \nstandalone: true                    # Forces standalone document  \npdf-engine: lualatex                 # Selects a specific pdf-engine  \noutput-file: output.pdf             # Name of the output file  \nmetadata:                           # Document-specific details  \n  title: \"Guide\"                    # Title  \n  author: \"Jacques Mock Schindler\"  # Author  \n  lang: en                          # Language of the document (de-CH for Swiss German)\n  fontsize: 11pt                    # Font size  \n  geometry: left=2.5cm, right=3cm   # Margins  \n  date: \"January 9, 2026\"           # Date  \n  toc: true                         # Creates a table of contents  \n  number-sections: true             # Numbers the headings\n```\n\nIndentation is important for the syntax in the YAML document. It\nconsists of two spaces. \n\nIf the file `format.yaml` is intended to control the PDF format, the\ncommand for converting the Markdown document into a PDF is: \n\n```bash\npandoc --defaults=format.yaml input.md\n```\n\nIf the name of the newly created PDF document is to be defined\nindividually with each command call, the line `output-file: output.pdf`\ncan be be omitted from the YAML file. In that case, the conversion command\nis:\n\n```bash\npandoc --defaults=format.yaml -o output.pdf input.md\n```\n\nIf reliance on external LaTeX packages is necessary for complex\nformatting, these are loaded via a separate `.tex` document. This\ndocument can also fundamentally be named anything. For this example, the\nfile is referred to as `header.tex`. The content of this file is to be\nformatted as follows: \n\n```tex\n\\usepackage{caption}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n```\n\nThe conversion command is now:\n\n```bash\npandoc --defaults=format.yaml -H header.tex input.md\n```\n\nThe [CTAN Comprehensive TeX Archive Network](https://ctan.org/) website\nprovides information on what LaTeX packages are available.
