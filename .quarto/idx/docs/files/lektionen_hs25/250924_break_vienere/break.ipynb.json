If\nthese sequences are 10 positions apart, the key length is likely a divisor of\n10 (1, 2, 5 or 10). \n\nFor a contrived example, if the plaintext is “the codes in the word and\nthe message”, and the key is “crypt”, then we’d get the following\nciphertext.\n\n```text\np: t h e c o d e s i n t h e w o r d a n d t h e m\nk: c r y p t c r y p t c r y p t c r y p t c r y p\nc: V Y C r h f v q x g V Y C l h t u y c w V Y C b\n```\n\nNote that the ciphertext pattern VYC occurs three times in the\nciphertext, and each time there is a distance of 10 letters between the\nbeginning of one VYC and the next. This happens because the same pattern\nof plaintext, “the”, lines up with the same part of the key, “cry”, each\ntime, resulting in the same ciphertext. The repetition of the keyword is\nthe liability here. The ciphertext duplicates are all 10 letters apart.\nBabbage and Kasiski reasoned that this implies the length of the key is\na factor of 10. The factors of 10 are 10, 5, and 2. One could argue that\na key of length 2 is too short to provide much security, so that a key\nof length 5 or 10 is more reasonable. A key of length 10 is unlikely to\nhave as many repetitions in such a short piece of ciphertext, so a key\nof length 5 is where the cryptanalyst will begin their work.\n\nA key of\nlength 5 means that the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, etc., letters are all\nenciphered using the same key letter and hence the same alphabet from\nthe Vigenère table. Similarly, the 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, etc. letters\nare all enciphered with the next key alphabet. So if we break up the\ncryptogram into 5 groups of letters we then have 5 monoalphabetic\nsubstitution ciphertexts. We can then do a frequency analysis of each\ngroup and solve each group separately. And in a standard shifted\nalphabet as in the normal Vigenère table, if we can find a single cipher\nalphabet letter we then have the entire alphabet.[^1]\n\n### Why It Works\nThe Vigenère cipher's weakness lies in key repetition.
